1. Project Creation
	•	Initiate New Project: Users initiate the creation of a new project by selecting the request type “Create New Project” (A1). This triggers the process of establishing a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) hierarchy.
	•	Default Values: The system auto-populates default values such as the Project Profile and Template based on the selected Investment Number.
	•	Data Entry: Users enter specific project details (e.g., project description, person responsible, finish date, profit center, cost center).
	•	System Validation: The system performs validations to ensure data integrity, such as verifying if cost centers and profit centers are valid for the current year.
	•	Request Creation: Once validated, the request is saved as a draft, awaiting further actions (e.g., submission).

2. Update Plan Values
	•	Plan Values Assignment: After the project’s details are entered, the system assigns plan values (budgets) to the project, ensuring they align with the financial parameters set by the organization.
	•	Automatic Population: If the investment program allows, the system auto-populates plan values from templates or investment reasons.

3. Update Budget
	•	Budget Distribution: The system distributes the budget from the Investment Management (IM) level to the 1st level of WBS.
	•	Budget Check: Users ensure the budget for the first level WBS does not exceed the available IM budget, using SAP function modules like IM_CHECK_WBS_ASSIGNMENT and IM_AVAILABILITY_CHECK.
	•	Budget Validation: The system performs validation to ensure the assigned budget is within limits and flags any discrepancies for review.

4. Settlement Rule Creation
	•	Create Settlement Rule: A settlement rule is generated for the WBS element based on the project’s parameters.
	•	Activate System Status: After the settlement rule is created, the system activates the appropriate statuses (e.g., SETC for Capitalized).

5. Workflow
	•	Approval Workflow: Once the project request is submitted, it triggers a workflow for approval based on the approval matrix defined in the system.
	•	Status Tracking: The request status is updated through the workflow (e.g., draft, pending approval, approved, rejected).
	•	Error Handling: If the workflow encounters errors, the request is either rejected or sent back for amendments.

6. Report
	•	Generate Report: A report is generated to provide details on the project request, including the WBS elements, budget, and any updates made during the project creation process.
	•	WBS Request Reporting: The report is based on data from custom tables (e.g., ZTB_A2R_WBSHDR, ZTB_A2R_WBSITEM), which store all project-related information and the status of the WBS elements.
